# Spring 2019 CS449 Recitation

## Update: Thanks for a great semester!

With the semester complete, I just want to say thank you for another wonderful semester.  I probably have any of you as students again, but I still look forward to seeing you
all around the department.  I hope you all have a good Summer!

I won't be updating this anymore, but I'll keep it up for your reference later.

## Update: Finals Week Office Hours

My finals week office hours will be:

- Tuesday from 12pm – 1pm 

- Wednesday from 10am – 12pm 

- Friday from 1pm – 3pm

In my usual office, SENSQ 5806

I may try to snag a different classroom if the office fills up, in that case, I'd put a sign on the door saying which
classroom I moved to.

Best of luck to everyone during finals week!
